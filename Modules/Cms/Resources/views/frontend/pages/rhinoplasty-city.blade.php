                        People mostly opt for Facelifts to improve their facial structure that has been
                        worn out with age. Hence, individuals from 40 to 60 years

                                    You could expect the surgeon to use various surgical and non-surgical methods
                                    for lip augmentation.
                                </li>

                                    Injecting fillers with hyaluronic acid into your lips is a common method.

                                    Several doctors also perform a lip lift or a lip implant to augment
                                    your lips permanently. So you could expect any of these
                                    treatments depending on the condition of your lips
                                </li>

                                    Lip augmentation surgery from a <?= $city ?> clinic will last for around 30 minutes.
                                    During this surgery, the surgeon will administer anesthesia
                                    to numb your lips.
                                </li>

                                    For lip implants, you could expect him to create a small incision in both

                                    side and threading it to the other incised corner.
                                    After pulling the implants through the tunnels,
                                    he will stitch the incisions
                                    to close them permanently

                                    It is good to have realistic expectations with the surgery.

                                <li>
                                    You could expect pain in the injection site and corners of your lips

                            For lip implants, you could expect him to create a small incision in both
                            corners of your mouth before inserting a clamp via one
                            side and threading it to the other incised corner.
                            After pulling the implants through the tunnels,
                            he will stitch the incisions

                            It is good to have realistic expectations with the surgery.

                    <p>
                        Once your ears attain their full size, you can undergo ear surgery.
                        Usually, the ears grow completely after the age of 5. However,
                        doctors recommend waiting till the age of 7 years to go for
                        the surgery in <?= $city ?>. From 7 to adulthood, any age
                        is fine to undergo the procedure.

                    <p>
                        The cost of liposuction mainly depends on various important
                        factors:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The choice of surgeon

                        <li>
                            The extent of fat you want to get eliminated

                        <li>
                            The location of fat removal

                        <li>
                            Additional costs such as medicines, anesthesia, surgery tools,
                            equipment, etc.

                    <p>
                        By considering all these factors, the cost of liposuction surgery can go up to six figures.
                        Hence, putting forth honest efforts to find the best cosmetic is inevitable before
                        spending a sumptuous amount on the surgery.

                            surgeons in Hyderabad. The surgery also becomes a necessity when

                            lower or upper eyelids. As for age, you should be around 30

                            at this age.

                        to get rid of fine lines, wrinkles, deep lines,
                        and sagging skin in the face and neck area.

                            On the day of the Neck Lift surgery in <?= ucwords($city) ?>, you will be given general

                        <li>
                            Your surgeon will make incisions to operate on the deep structural tissues
                            of the lower face and neck.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You could also expect the surgeon to remove the excess skin

                            The entire surgery will continue for 1-3 hours and will work

                        <li>
                            Usually, it will take around 2 weeks for pain, swelling, and bruising to resolve

                        A Body Lift can help you to get rid of excess fat and sagging skin. There are times when some fat deposits do not disintegrate even when you diet and exercise hard. A Body Lift surgery removes or minimizes these fat deposits and tightens your skin for a well-toned body appearance.
